# Smart_hostel_management

The objective of this Web application is to ease the communication process between students and the hostel authorities. It was a two-way login portal in which students can raise their issue regarding hostel (electricity, water, LAN, etc) and monitor the status of their request.</br>
Hostel authorities can also update any hostel related information (mess off, leave status, etc) through this portal.
